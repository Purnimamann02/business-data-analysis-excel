Business sales data analysis project using Excel (Power Query, PivotTables, and Dashboards)
Business Sales Data Analysis â€“ Excel Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes a retail sales dataset to uncover insights about customers, products, shipping performance, and profitability. The goal was to transform raw data into a decision-making dashboard that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs), business strengths, and areas for improvement.
Using Excel (Power Query, PivotTables, Dashboards), I cleaned, modeled, and visualized the dataset to answer business-critical questions such as:
Who are the top customers by sales and order frequency?
Which segments, cities, and states drive the most sales?
What are the most profitable and least profitable products?
How long does it take for orders to reach customers by shipping mode?
How do actual sales compare to targets (KPI tracking)?
